## What does this PR do?

- Short description of the change and why it's needed

## Checklist
- [ ] I asked maintainers for preference on language/license/CI before creating scaffolding
- [ ] I added tests or explained why tests are not applicable
- [ ] I added documentation / updated README if required

## How to test locally
- Steps to run or commands to check the change

## Notes
- If this is scaffolding, mention what was added (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `workflow`), and keep changes minimal and reversible.

> **Note:** If you want CI to upload coverage to Codecov, add a repository secret named `CODECOV_TOKEN` (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret). The workflow will skip uploads if the secret is not set.
